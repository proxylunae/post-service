If you install react-devtools as a project dependency, you may also replace the <script> suggested above
 with a JavaScript import (import 'react-devtools').
It is important that this import comes before any other imports in your app (especially before react-dom).
Make sure to remove the import before deploying to production, as it carries a large DevTools client with it.
If you use Webpack and have control over its configuration,
you could alternatively add 'react-devtools' as the first item
in the entry array of the development-only configuration,
and then you wouldnâ€™t need to deal either with <script> tags or import statements.
